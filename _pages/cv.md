## Education
* B.S. in Physics, Peking University, 2010
* Ph.D in Applied Physics, Stanford University, 2016

## Research
* Photonics Inverse Design & Quantum Optics
  * Stanford University, 2018-present, with Jelena Vuckovic
  * Creating Inverse-Designed (InvDes) 3D photonic structures for optical communications via physics simulation, optimization and 3D printing.
  * Demonstrated 1st InvDes Si photonic devices fabricated by a commercial foundry.
  * Combining InvDes mid-/near-IR photonic structures and 2D materials for sensors and modulators.

* Ultrafast Opto-electronics of 2D Materials
  * Stanford University & SLAC, 2016-present, with Tony Heinz
  * Probing ultrafast electron dynamics in 2D materials via laser-based time-domain THz spectroscopy and physics simulations.
  * Building custom instruments and data analysis pipelines to probe optical properties of 2D materials from mid-IR to deep-UV.
  
* Emerging Electronic States at Boundaries & Domain Walls in Quantum Materials
  * Stanford University, 2010-2016, with Zhi-Xun Shen
  * Developed the first miliKelvin, time-resolved, optically-coupled and tuning-fork-based Microwave Impedance Microscopy (MIM) to non-invasively probe emerging electronic states in quantum materials with nanometer resolution.
  * Discovered the first magnetic insulator with [metallic domain walls](https://newatlas.com/magnetic-insulator-memory-storage-slac/40166/) that can be used as new sensors and non-volatile memories.
