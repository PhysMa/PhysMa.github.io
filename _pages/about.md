Hi, I am Eric Yue Ma, currently a Postdoctoral Scholar at Stanford University working with [Jelena Vuckovic](https://web.stanford.edu/~jela/) and [Tony Heinz](https://web.stanford.edu/dept/app-physics/cgi-bin/person/tony-heinz-january-2015/). I am an aspiring applied physicist with deep understanding of fundamental physics and broad expertise in a variety of scientific topics in materials, light-matter interaction and photonics. I strive to use my knowledge and talent to make a societal impact.
